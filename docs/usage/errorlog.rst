Errorlog
========
In most cases errors are reported directly to users, but where this cannot be reported to users, the errors are logged. These are mainly errors in the field of email, communication with the payment provider and database errors.

This menu option shows you all errors from the last month. Errors older than a month are automatically removed.

Example errorlog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table::

    * - .. image:: ../_static/images/usage/Errorlog-example.png
           :target: ../_static/images/usage/Errorlog-example.png
           :alt: Errorlog example

The error messages are not generated by *Fast Events* but by the underlying email provider, payment provider or database provider. But in most cases the errors are pretty self-explanatory.

In the event of errors, it is wise to review the web server logs as well to assess how the error originated.
