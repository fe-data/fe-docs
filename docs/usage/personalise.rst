Ticket personalisation
======================

A detailed explanation is coming soon ...

If you want to use personalisation for an event, you can add a shortcode to the ``Thank you``-page.
This is the page you have configured in the ``Redirect after booking`` in the *Basic Settings* of the event.

The shortcode is :guilabel:`[fe_personalise]`. It is also possible to use :guilabel:`[fe_personalise cdn]`.
The latter will retrieve the supporting files from the Cloudflare CDN and thus saving your server some hits.
