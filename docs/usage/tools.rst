           :alt: Error log

This menu option shows you all errors from the last 30 days. Errors older than a month are automatically removed.
Errors are truncated in the overview. Click/tap on the card to see it in full.
Swipe the card left or right to delete the error.

Most messages are not generated by *Fast Events* but by the underlying email provider, payment provider or database provider.
But in most cases the errors are pretty self-explanatory.

In the event of errors, it is wise to review the web server logs as well to assess how the error originated.

Email lists

           :alt: Email lists

Upload a CSV (comma seperated file) and link it to an event. The file should contain a name, emailaddress and number.
The number is the maximum number of tickets the user can buy. Emaillists work together with `Groups <events.html#groups>`_.
You need to set the :guilabel:`Group type` to ``Email list`` for the event to make use of the email list.

It is possible to overwrite the email list. Existing email addresses are then overwritten and new ones are added.
However, no email addresses are deleted.

.. note:: Make sure that the fields are separated by a ``;`` and that the fields are embedded in ``"``.

           :alt: Send order emails

During normal operations there should not be a need to send order emails as they are emailed automatically after the customer has paid for the order.
But maybe the email that automatically got send did contain a serious fault or omission,
or if your email-system or email-provider wasn't available for a period of time.
Well than this tool might be handy. Make sure you make the necessary adjustments and off you go.

All conditions in the fields below are included in the selection.

After you click :guilabel:`Bulk order email`, the system will show a dialog.
After all the fields are filled in, you can press the database search icon and a follow-up screen will come up with the number of order selected.
Press :guilabel:`Start` to process the orders.

A progress bar will keep you informed on the progress. Don’t close the window until the bar has reached 100%.

**Select events**
   You can selected multiple events.
**Order between dates**
   Click on the grayed out date and click on the first date and click on the last date. The orders between these date-times are processed.
**# Tickets between**
   Only orders with the number of tickets between these values are processed.
**Amount between**
   Only order amounts between these values are processed.

**Email subject**
   Don't leave the mail subject empty
**Email body**
   A smart editor where you can create your own fancy styled email. A word of advice: keep it simple and small and don’t pull in large images.
   If you still have the desire to use images, use links from your own site or a CDN.

   You can use a couple of keywords and *Fast Events* will replace them with the info available in the order:
   
   - :guilabel:`{%NAME%}` is the name of the person who placed the order.
   - :guilabel:`{%EMAIL%}` is the email address of the person who placed the order.
   - :guilabel:`{%YEAR%}` substitute the current year (YYYY).
   - :guilabel:`{%TICKETS%}` the unique link for downloading the e-tickets.
   - :guilabel:`{%DOWNLOAD-TICKETS%}` insert the following block with the appropriate links to download the tickets.

     .. list-table::

         * - .. image:: ../_static/images/usage/Download-tickets.png
                :target: ../_static/images/usage/Download-tickets.png
                :alt: Download tickets block

   - :guilabel:`{%PERSONALISE%}` insert the personalisation link for the tickets.
   - :guilabel:`{%INVOICE%}` the unique link for downloading the invoice.
   - :guilabel:`{%FIELDS%}` the input fields from the `input fields <events.html#input-fields>`__ in table format.
   - :guilabel:`{%CONFIRM%}` only applicable for RSVP events (no e-tickets). The link to confirm that you will be present.
   
Don’t forget to test your email if it is ‘**spam-proof**‘.
There are many tools available on the Internet, but we recommend using https://www.mail-tester.com/
Click the :guilabel:`Send test email` button and use the email address on the mail-tester site and within a minute you have detailed report.
Be pretty serious about this, because if your email gets a high spam rating from receiving domains,
your mails may end up in ‘*Spam*‘ folders or won’t be delivered at all.
Or worse, your domain can be blacklisted.

**Deep dive**
   For the experts: the email itself is embedded in a container of maximum 600px wide. Always test on your mobile first if the email formats well.
   Don’t include images straight from your camera, which can be several Mb’s.
   If you want to include images, keep the resolution at an acceptable level and pull the image through tools like https://kraken.io to squeeze the size.

   *Fast Events* will ‘purify’ the email to prevent XSS-attacks, e.g. scripts are not allowed.

Admin accounts
--------------
See how regular accounts can be configured `here <../apps/admin.html#regular-accounts>`_.

Example usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here are a few examples of how accounts can be used for different purposes.
In the examples, we show in each case which permissions need to be turned on to limit the functionality of the FE Admin App to only the desired features.
There a 3 permission groups: ``Events``, ``Orders`` and ``Tools``. If the relevant group is not mentioned, it means that all permissions are off.
And of course, the number of visible events can also be limited while adding/changing an account in the ``Authorised events`` tab.

**Sales overview**
   *An account where it is only possible to see how many tickets have been sold.*

   - Events: ``Read events`` and ``Sales dashboard``
   - Tools: ``Sales dashboard``

**Customer support**
   *While ordering, there will always be customers who enter the wrong email address or that the email does not arrive..
   Someone can then provide support (by phone, chat,...) and verify the request and resend or send the emails to another email address.
   Customer details can also be changed.*

   - Orders: ``Read orders``, ``Show order details``, ``Show detailed payment information``, ``Resend email order confirmation``,
     ``Edit customer details`` and ``Read order log entries``

**Scan management**
   *Someone is responsible for configuring scan keys and configuring the Scan App of those who are at the various locations to scan tickets.*

   - Events:: ``Read events``, ``Total scans``, ``Show ticket types``, ``Show scan keys`` and ``Change scan keys``

Accounts or sub-accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Of course, you can create separate accounts for each type of account, and at the WordPress level, that translates into multiple users.
Each user then has their own login name, API key and Application Password.
Configuring it is a bit more work, as each user needs to get their own configuration qrcode to configure the FE Admin App.

But there is also another approach by using sub-accounts. First, configure an account in which all permissions required by the sub-accounts are turned on.
Then define the sub-accounts and turn on only the permissions that are needed and, if necessary, limit the visible events.
At the WordPress level, only 1 user is visible. All sub-accounts share the same login name and API key and thus can all use the same configuration qrcode to configure the FE Admin App.
However, the sub-accounts all have a different Application Password.

Preferably use sub-accounts if the *Fast Events* plugin is configured in ``Saas`` mode.
