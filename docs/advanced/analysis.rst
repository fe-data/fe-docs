Data analysis
=============
We don’t have nice dashboards with all kinds of graphs and diagrams, because there are numerous online tools available that do exactly that.

Whats is available
------------------
Just click on the popupmenu of the :guilabel:`Events` overview to show the actual sold tickets or how many tickets have been scanned,
but we also offer you a fast download of the order data in csv-format.
Use the ``Export orders``, ``Export tickets`` or ``Export scans`` in the :guilabel:`Tools` section.

Within a split second it downloads tens of thousands of orders.
Pull it into you favorite spreadsheet tool (Excel, LibreOffice, …) and create your own pivot-table and associated graphs.
Your own fantasy is the only limitation of creating fancy charts.

Alternatives
------------
But there are also some nice online pivot tools available. We recommend to take a look at `Seektable <https://www.seektable.com/>`_.

There are plenty of others, search on `Google <https://www.google.com/search?q=online+pivot+tools>`_.
