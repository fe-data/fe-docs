Data analysis
=============
We don’t provide built‑in dashboards with graphs and diagrams because numerous online tools already do that.

Whats is available
------------------
Just click the :guilabel:`Events` overview’s popup‑menu to see how many tickets have been sold or scanned.
You can also quickly download the order data in CSV format
Use the ``Export orders``, ``Export tickets`` or ``Export scans`` in the :guilabel:`Tools` section.

Within a split second it downloads tens of thousands of orders.
Import the CSV into your favorite spreadsheet program (Excel, LibreOffice, …) and build your own pivot tables and charts.
Your imagination is the only limit when creating fancy visualisations.

Alternatives
------------
But there are also some great online pivot tools available. We recommend taking a look at `Seektable <https://www.seektable.com/>`_.

There are many other options, you can find them by searching on  `Google <https://www.google.com/search?q=online+pivot+tools>`_.
