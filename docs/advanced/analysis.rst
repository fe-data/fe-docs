Data analysis
=============
We don’t have nice dashboards with all kinds of graphs and diagrams, because there are numerous online tools available that do exactly that.

Whats is available
------------------
The ``Events`` menu shows you the actual sold tickets. In the ``Orders`` menu you can view information on how many tickets types have been sold and how many tickets have been scanned, but we also offer you a fast download of the order data in csv-format.

Within a split second it downloads tens of thousands of orders. Pull it into you favorite spreadsheet tool (Excel, LibreOffice, …) and create your own pivot-table and associated graphs. Your own fantasy is the only limitation of creating fancy charts.

Alternatives
------------
But there are also some nice online pivot tools available. We recommend to take a look at `Seektable <https://www.seektable.com/>`_.

Not for the faint of heart is using the :doc:`fast_events_new_order <../hooks/new_order>` hook and feed the new order data into `Google Analytics <https://analytics.google.com/>`_. You get real-time access to a flood of data about your sales activity in reports and graphs. `Install Google Analytics <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.giant>`_ on your mobile and you will always have the data available at your fingertips. Look here for an `example <../hooks/new_order.html#google-analytics-ecommerce>`_.
