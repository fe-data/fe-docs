Apps
-----
With Fast Events you can use our free scan app for Android and IOS. No need for expensive scanning equipment, just use your phone.
There is also a free payment app. The user scans a QR code and the payment is carried out easily and securely.

Use the `FE Tracking App <https://fe-tracking.fast-events.eu/>`_ for sports events in particular to enable participants
to signal checkpoints on the route in the App and possibly upload them to the server of the event organizer's server when they have been passed.
Enjoy real-time route updates and news from the organisation about the event.

For Android there is also an Admin App available. You can view events and orders and change them on the go. Or show the stats of sold tickets and scanned tickets. And much more ...
