Tracking App
============
Use the `FE Tracking App <https://fe-tracking.fast-events.eu/>`_ for sports events in particular to enable participants
to signal checkpoints on the route in the App and possibly upload them to the server of the event organizer's server when they have been passed.

Detailed information about the App can be found `here <https://fe-tracking.fast-events.eu/>`_.
